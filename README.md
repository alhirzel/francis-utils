=============

C code for the Francis (implicit QR) algorithm including bulge chasing

This also aims to be a good "quick-start" example on using the ATLAS BLAS
library (and indeed other compatible BLAS libraries). This author found the
barrier of entry to using BLAS libaries was rather high; hopefully this code
is helpful to others in this regard.

Written by Alex Hirzel for Dr. Allan Struthers' Automatic Differentiation class
at Michigan Technological University (mtu.edu). Based on work by collaborators
Peter Solfest and Ryan Bruner.
