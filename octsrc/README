This folder contains an optimized version of implicit qr bulge-chasing

impStep.m - octave code which takes a hessenberg form as input.
Here is how to use it:
impStep(<Matrix>,<Vector of Shifts>, <true/false>)
The matrix needs to be hessenberg, the shifts should number
less than the matrix dimension, and true tells it to
print the images to png's

hessen.m - octave code which takes a matrix and spits out it's
hessenberg reduction.

How to create movies:
the impStep will print out a series of pictures to the folder
impStepPlots.
once this is done, go to the folder and type 'make'.
This will create a new folder (by the name of the date in number
format), create a gif which loops through all the images,
then move all these images to the new folder.

warnings: DO NOT have impStep produce 2 series of images without
creating the gif (or at least moving the png's to another folder) first.
This will cause havoc the next time you try to create a gif.

This require's imageMagick's convert function - hope the school computers
have that
